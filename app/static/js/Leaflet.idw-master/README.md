# Leaflet.idw
A small Leaflet plugin to generate an IDW interpolated map

A tiny, simple and fast Leaflet inverse distance weighting plugin. Largely based on the [Leaflet.heat](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.heat) plugin by Vladimir Agafonkin.

Leaflet.idw implements a [simple inverse distance weighting algorithm](http://www.gitta.info/ContiSpatVar/de/html/Interpolatio_learningObject2.xhtml)). Every cell is calculated with the center of the cell (h/2,w/2) as the anchor from which the distance to the points is calculated.

## Demos
* [Example with ~100 points and cell size = 3](http://www.geonet.ch/leaflet-idw/) *(Mobile: Working on Samsung Galaxy s4)*
    
## Examples
CellSize: 1

# Basic Usage

```
var idw = L.idwLayer([
    [50.5, 30.5, 0.2], // lat, lng, intensity
    [50.6, 30.4, 0.5],
    ...
], {opacity: 0.3, cellSize: 10, exp: 2, max: 1200}).addTo(map);
```

To include the plugin, just use leaflet-idw.js from the src folder:

```<script src="leaflet-idw.js"></script>```

## Options

Constructs an IDW layer given an array of points and an object with the following options:

    opacity - the opacity of the IDW layer
    max - maximum point values, 1.0 by default
    cellSize - height and width of each cell, 25 by default
    exp - exponent used for weighting, 1 by default
    gradient - color gradient config, e.g. {0.4: 'blue', 0.65: 'lime', 1: 'red'}

Each point in the input array can be either an array like [50.5, 30.5, 0.5], or a Leaflet LatLng object.

Third argument in each LatLng point represents point value. Unless max option is specified, values should range between 0.0 and 1.0.

## Performance

Performance is linked to number of points and cell size:

# ToDo
- [ ] Delete unneeded parts of the code
- [x] Rewrite code so that no greyscale image is generated first. Directly generate and color the cells
    * Performance tested
- [x] Fix CellSize option: Now CellSize option X 2 = Cell width and height in pixels. (CellSize : 1 = 2x2 pixel cell)
- [ ] Introduce a loading icon
- [ ] Add the option for a bounding box
- [ ] Cluster points to increase performance
    * If points in cell then take average for cell
- [ ] Define bounding box for which points are used for each cell to increase performance
- [ ] Introduce option to do IDW in map units and not in viewport?
- [ ] Calculate one map tile after the other to minimise risk of browser freeze?
- [ ] Split pipeline into processing and displaying? Save Grid after processing?
